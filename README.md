# CatRescueGame
meow =^.^=

This is my final project for PHYS30672 Object Oriented Programming in C++. 
Date of submission: 17th May 2021. 
The title of this game is Cat Rescue, based upon the game of the same name as designed by Ta-Te Wu. 
This game is dedicated to all the selfless volunteers who save feline lives every day in cat shelters across the country. 
Thank you!
